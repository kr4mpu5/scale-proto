# Implementation “Spike”
Using any technologies you prefer (language, framework, cloud services, open source projects, third-party products, etc.), develop a quick & dirty “spike” for the product.

The purpose of this task is to answer the question “What is the simplest thing we can program that will convince us we are on the right track?” You can choose to simplify areas that you feel are extraneous to understanding the problem (for example, removing authentication or video uploads).

* Include a link to the code you developed

* Why did you focus on certain aspects of implementation?

* What did you learn from this process, and what (if anything) would you change about the System Design & Technical Plan?
